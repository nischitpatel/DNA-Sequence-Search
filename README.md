# Large-scale-data-structures

## Description:
This GitHub repository showcases an in-depth exploration of handling large-scale data structures with a progressive approach to optimization. The journey begins with a basic brute-force implementation, emphasizing simplicity in processing and searching through extensive datasets. As the scale of data grows, it becomes evident that the brute-force approach is impractical due to excessive processing times.

The repository provides a comprehensive demonstration of transitioning from the brute-force methodology to more efficient data structures. The initial implementation focuses on the challenges posed by large-scale data and highlights the need for optimization. Subsequent iterations introduce advanced data structures such as hash tables, illustrating their effectiveness in enhancing search efficiency.

As the optimization journey continues, the repository culminates in the implementation of a prefix trie. This powerful data structure proves to be a game-changer in terms of both processing speed and memory utilization, making it an ideal solution for handling vast amounts of data.
